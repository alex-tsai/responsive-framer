# responsive-framer

Code snippet for prototyping with responsive layouts and elements.

1. 'scrH' and 'scrW' and are 1% for the height and width of the device screen respectively. This allows us to create elements and layouts that adjust depending on the device dimensions instead of being fixed.
2.  There are several booleans that can be used in conjunction with if statements to display different layouts depending on the screen dimensions.
3.  Functions for vertical and horizontal alignments. All the functions have two parameters one to select which layer is being aligned, and the second is an offset from the screen edges or center.
